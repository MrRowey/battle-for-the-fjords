1. Currently the mission will start with the player/s spawning in at the red area of the map. This is where the players will first be that on mission start you will spawn in are the red section to build up your start base needed that is instructed by the academy officials.
2. Once base has been 50% constructed the map will expand to see your allied base in the orange who will provide air cover for your commander.
3. When you have completed the objects of defending your allied base your Operational area will expand to the first Enemy position that you will need to engage this is in the Lime Colour.
4. Once the primary FOB is destroying the Area will expand to the Secondary FOB that is attacking your allied base and you will be tasked to destroy it before staging the final assault.
5. Once the secondary FOB is destroyed the map will have one final expansion and you will be needed to destroy the enemy Base commander along with any quantum gate to prevent from any escape from this planet to avoid us from being overrun.
