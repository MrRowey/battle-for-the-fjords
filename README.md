- The Current plan is that On mission start you will spawn in ar the red secion to build up your start base needed thats instructed by the acadamy officals.
- Once base has been 50% constructed the map will expand to see your allied base in the orange
- when you have completed the objects of defennding your allied base your Operationa area will expand to the first Enemy postion that you will need to engaded this is in the Lime Colour.
- Once the primary FOB is destrys the Area will expand to the Seconday FOB that is attacking your allied base and you will taksed to desty it befoer staing the final assult.
- once the sconday FOB is destorey the Map will have one final expacion and you will be need to destyr the enemy Base commander along with any Quantum Gate to prevet from any esape from this planet to avoid us from being over run.
